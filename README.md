Final Project on Harassment and Bullying 

The primarly purpose of this project is the observe the analysis of 2017-18 harassment/bullying civil rights data collection. Our group selected a 2017-18 Harassment or Bullying Civil Rights Data Collection dataset. This dataset contains information on students disciplined for harassment or bullying based on sex, race, or disability category for all states. 
The file we selected contains three spreadsheets: total students, male students, and female students. Through analysis of this data, the impact of race/ethnicity, gender, and disability groups served on harassment/bullying was observed. As additional analysis, the number of disciplines for harassment/bullying was observed at a state level, first as a whole, and then a comparison of male and female reports. With the findings, conclusions were drawn, and policies were created to positively impact the amount of harassment and bullying that occurs in the school system. There are seven attached files within this project repository.
